Fabric Bolt
===========

Fabric Bolt is a Python/Django project that allows you to deploy code stored in source control (a project)
to a target server (host). Fabric Bolt provides convenient web interfaces to configure both the projects and
the hosts. Additionally, deployment history and logs are stored so that you know who deployed what on which day.
